# SIT-VendingMachine
A "Vending Machine Management System" developed using "Python (Tkinter GUI)" and "MySQL database" integration!
🚀 Project Showcase: SIT Vending Machine System 🥤🍫💻

I’m excited to share one of my recent projects — a " Vending Machine Management System" developed using "Python (Tkinter GUI)" and "MySQL database" integration!

🔧 Key Features:

* User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
* Item-based purchase system using unique item codes (e.g., a1, b2)
* Simulated GPay payment system
* Purchase receipt generation
* Admin-level item management (Add/Update/Delete)
* Live stock tracking from MySQL

🎯 Goal: To simulate an interactive, real-time vending machine experience for our SIT College environment — blending software engineering with real-world application.

📚 This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

* GUI development
* CRUD operations in MySQL
* Backend logic integration with frontend
* Real-time user interaction handling

I’m continuously working to improve its features and looking forward to deploying it in a practical setting!

💡 Looking for feedback or collaboration ideas from the community!
